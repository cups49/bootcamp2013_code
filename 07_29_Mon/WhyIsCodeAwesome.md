## Why is code awesome?

* Code has been around for a while. It's essentially  a recipe for dealing with information. Law, religion, architecture, music, cartography, etc., all use similar methods of classifying and processing information. (Show maps and diagrams).

* Look around to see how much of our everyday life is affected by code, algorithms and databases. The subway, elevators, shopping, hospitals, schools, and cellphones, plus many other objects we depend upon, are controlled by various forms of code.

* We can be users of technology in a black box. Most of us have only a superficial understanding of what happens behind an email, a Google search, or pressing a button on an elevator, for example. (Catalina's thesis).

* How we can be critical about the world and understand where and how to intervene if we don't understand what moves the machinery behind the curtains???

* As designers and artists, part of our job is to know the rules, to play with them, to expose them, or to blend them. (Avatar blenders).

* Knowing code today is the equivalent of learning sociology, printmaking, alchemy, or mathematics in the past. It gives us the power to understand how the world around us is constructed and how it works. 

* An understanding of code can give us the power to stop being merely users and to make the jump to being makers. We can become active participants in the world, and intelligently introduce discussion and analysis around things others may take for granted. We become ironworkers to forge a bright tomorrow. 

* It is also important to provide access to others to this powerful knowledge. Democracy is in jeopardy if people live at the whim of only a few who control the power structures of our society. We run this risk if we live in ignorance, blind to the processes behind the monitors and keyboards. There is no freedom without committed people ready to question, intervene and re-design these processes.

* Here today, we start building a transparent future by learning the building-blocks of the digital age in which we live.
