## Why is code awesome?

* Code have been around for a while. It's essentially recipes for dealing with information. Law, religious, architecture, music, cartography, etc ( show maps and diagrams )

* Look around and see how much of our every-day life is using by code, algorithms or database? 

* We become users and technology a black box. Most of us have a very superficial understanding of what happens behind an email, a google search, pressing a button on an elevator, etc.

* How we can be critical about the world and make right interventions if we don't understand what moves the pulls behind curtains. 

* As designers/artists part of our job is to know the rules, play with them, expose them or blend them.

* Knowing code today is the equivalent of learning sociology, printmaking, alchemy or mathematics. It give us the power to understand how the world around is constructed and how it works.

* Gives us the power to stop been users and jump to been makers. Active participants, those how put discussions over the table. Ironworkers to forge a bright tomorrow. 

* Let's thing how important is to give equal access to this powerful knowledge. There is now real democracy if people lives in ignorance. If we are blind of the processes behind the monitors and keyboards. There is no freedom without committed people ready to intervene and re-design this process.

* Here and today, we can start building a transparent future by learning the building-blocks of the digital age we meant to live.
