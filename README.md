# PARSONS THE NEW SCHOOL FOR DESIGN
# Summer 2013 Bootcamp Code Syllabus

## Learning Outcomes
Give students a general understanding of what code is, the history of code, how it is currently used, the advantages and limitations of code.
Show students how useful code is for an artist (installation art, openframeworks, web, etc).  Contextualize code in an artistic/interactive setting. Provide resources, books, videos on inspirational artists.
Give students resources, both online and in print, to further their coding knowledge.  Introduce students to the open source community as both a learning and sharing tool.
Introduce students to different open source coding platforms, their uses, strengths and weaknesses. Many of these platforms will be further covered in weekend dorkShoop workshops.
 Understand basic code data types, syntax, and gain a basic feeling for how the “machine” interprets this information.
Understand more complex features of code (functions, loops, arrays) and how these can be used to organize/simplify projects.
Strong emphasis on applying human logic (thinking) into code oriented logic (pseudo code). Also emphasis on breaking problems down.


## Workload
Daily readings/videos and/or assignments will be given the first two weeks. The final week students will work towards a final project. Daily work load will vary depending on assignment and skill level, but 1-3 hours can be expected.

## Lesson Plan Template

* **5min** informal talk. How are you? What's going on? Did anyone see anything cool? 
* **5min** show amazing stuff. Describe how what we are going to do is oriented to that.
* **5min** show and tell homework that the are proud of (2 by class - picked).
* **45min** TEACH SOME CODE
* **10min** Break
* **45min** TEACH SOME CODE
* **5min** Explain homework


## Attendance and Grading

* Pass/Fail course.

* **Attendance**: Only one absence is allowed. The second absence will be reported, and
subsequent absences will result in a failure for this section of Boot Camp.

* **Grading**: Grading will be on a pass fail basis, with a higher concern placed in individual
improvement rather than base knowledge.

* **Plagiarism**: Plagiarism will result in an automatic failure. Working in groups and referring to online resources is a great way to learn and is completely acceptable. Trying to pass off the work of others as your own is not. Code examples, starting points, or collaborative work should be credited where credit is due.
