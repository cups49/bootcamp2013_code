# Summer 2013 Bootcamp Code Syllabus
-------------------------------------------------------------------

# Thu 1 Aug DAY 4

##Learn and Practice:
####Dynamic sketching/Structure
* Assigning Variables
* Setup/Draw
* Functions
* Order
* Scope 
* Commenting, Debugging, Iterating, pseudo code


####User Interactions  
* MouseX
* MouseY
* pmouseX
* pmouseY
* dist (speed)

####Operators and Conditionals  
* If/else, and ( && ), or  ( || ), Not ( ! )
* Random, noise

####Animation 1  
* background in draw 
* Increment (++) and decrement ( -- ); 
* frameRate


##Classwork/Homework:
* Develop pseudo code for a bouncing ball sketch in class (in pairs). 
* Use pseudo code as a guideline for homework assignment: a bouncing ball. During next class, students will expose the sketch in class gradually, by uncommenting code.

##Resources
* Learning Processing: the rest of "Chapter 5. Conditionals" until Physics
* Processing (book), Development 2: Iterations, debugging
